The Frontend Code is present in the folder frontend-v1.
The backend code is present in the folder serverside-v1.

A Small Introduction of the project before we deep dive into it.

### The backend has been designed and implemented keeping in mind the following Principles -
  1. Scalability - The System would be scalable only when its as efficient at a high request count as it was in low request count.
  2. Extendability - The System should be flexible enough to facilitate the add of new entitites and modules in the system without causing any major refractor.
  3. Modularity - Have divided the backend into separate, self-contained modules or components. This modular approach should make it easier to maintain and update specific parts of the system without affecting the entire codebase.


### The Frontend has been designed keeping the following things in mind - 
  1. Future Scope -  Although built for lower scale the choice of my frontend framework was Next.js keeping in mind the features we could extend to like Server Side Rendering, Hot Module Replacement (HMR), Static Site Generation (SSG), API Routes.
  2. Robustness - TypeScript's static typing helps catch errors at compile-time, leading to more robust code and reducing runtime errors.
